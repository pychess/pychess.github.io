<h3>PyChess 0.12 Anderssen rc4 released</h3>
<p>2015/08/16: We're pleased to announce, that a new PyChess Anderssen 0.12 rc4 has been made available. In most cases rc4 should contain only final fixes, but after rc3 we faced that fixing random crashes and freezees is nearly impossible. (It was caused by using old/deprecated way of pygtk threading.) So we decided to rewrite all our code in the supported way. At the same time we started to port PyChess to Python3 and John Cheetham started to port PyChess to Gtk3 too. After merging these branches it opened the way to support Windows (the old/deprecated threading mode was never supported on Windows). Finally with the help of Leonardo Gregianin PyChess now has experimental Windows support! (No installer yet.)</p>
<p>
<p>Some other new variant support was implemented too:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>ASEAN, Makruk(Thai), OukChatrang(Cambodian), Sittuyin(Burmese)</li>
<li>King of the hill</li>
<li>Three check</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Other minor enhancements:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Adding Windows engines on Linux</li>
<li>Auto save games</li>
<li>Auto adding engines if they ship .eng files</li>
<li>Copy PGN to clipboard</li>
</ul></p>

<p>This is great news, and we thank our great users for spreading the love, and our developers for bringing us ever better and more stable PyChess releases!</p>
<p>The BabasChess stats bot does however also show, that some distributions are very slow at delivering the latest releases to their users. This is something we notice a lot on the issue tracker, but we haven't had too much of an idea of the actual numbers.</p>

<h3>Staunton 0.10 Final!</h3>
<p>This release of PyChess has been on the way for more than two years.
We have had a lot of last minute fixes since the release candidate.
A few of them for bugs that have been around a long time.
In particular there has been a lot of stabilization of CECP and UCI,
so they should now work with an even wider set of engines.
You can even run windows engines through wine.</p>
